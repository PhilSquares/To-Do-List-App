# To-Do-List-App
To-Do List App that displays the current day, month, and date to the user. The application allows users to add items to a list and check off/cross out each item as tasks are completed. I've also added an additional route to the application "/work" that presents a new list title "Work List" on a different page so users can add work specific tasks outside of a normal everyday task list. Check out a live demo by clicking the link below.
